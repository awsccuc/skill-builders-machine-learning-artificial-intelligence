# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence

## What is Machine Learning?

According to Columbia University, "artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments, while machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data." [source](https://ai.engineering.columbia.edu/ai-vs-machine-learning/).

## Why should you learn Machine Learning as a student?

Machine learning helps you automate tasks, which would usually be time consuming and difficult if done manually. You may have seen how you receive recommendations on the Amazon shopping app about what to buy based on your previous purchases. Machine learning achieves this feat by analyzing lots of data to learn obvious patterns on how one product is related to another. For example, you can use machine learning to train a chatbot that can answer queries about a specific product when a user has doubts before purchasing it.

# Machine Learning Camp for AWS Cloud Clubs

If you're a member or a leader of an [AWS Cloud Club](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cloud-clubs/), you can participate in "ML Camp" located here: "[Build Your First Machine Learning Web App](https://s12d.com/mlapi-camp)", where you'll learn the basics of applied Machine Learning on AWS.

What's "Camp"? It's a workshop, only better! With a trained facilitator, work through the modules in the workshop [here](https://s12d.com/mlapi-camp). They include quizzes and challenges and the ability to earn a badge on completion of the Camp. While this experience is normally available for AWS Cloud Clubs, reach out to awscloudclubs@amazon.com if you'd like to run this Camp in a non-Cloud Club environment.

- Training Video - coming soon
- Powerpoint for instructors is available - please email us at awscloudclubs@amazon.com
